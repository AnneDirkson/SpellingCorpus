# SpellingCorpus

The spelling mistake corpus is a corpus of 46 spelling mistakes found in 1000 random posts of the GIST International Support Facebook forum for Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) patients. Their corrections were determined first individually by AR Dirkson and a domain expert and then compared and agreed upon.
