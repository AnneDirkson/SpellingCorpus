# SpellingCorpus

The medical spelling mistake corpus is a corpus of 46 spelling mistakes found in 1000 random posts of the GIST International Support Facebook forum for Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) patients. Their corrections were determined first individually by AR Dirkson and a domain expert and then compared and agreed upon. 

Additionally, for the same 1000 posts all mistakes have been identified. The first set of 500 posts forms the tuning set for developing a mistake detection system and the second set of 500 posts from the test set. Both sets contain all found mistakes and a ten-fold of correct words with the same length distribution as the mistakes. This reflects the imbalance also found in real data.
